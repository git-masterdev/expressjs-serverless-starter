### Requirements

- Node.js and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ixartz/Serverless-Boilerplate-Express-TypeScript.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```
npm run dev
```

The local server is now listening at http://localhost:4000

### Deploy to production

You can deploy to production with the following command:

```
npm run deploy-prod
```

### Things to know

`serverless-offline-plugin` display a red warning in the console `offline: [object Object]`. It's just a warning from [Serverless Offline Plugin](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/blob/b39e8cf23592ad8bca568566e10c3db3469a951b/src/utils/getHttpApiCorsConfig.js). Hope it'll solve in the next release of `serverless-offline-plugin`.

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
