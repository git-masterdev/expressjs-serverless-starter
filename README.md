### Requirements

- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ixartz/Serverless-Boilerplate-Express-TypeScript.git my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```
npm run dev
```

The local server is now listening at http://localhost:4000

### Deploy to production

You can deploy to production with the following command:

```
npm run deploy-prod
```

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.
